# Backend Challenges boilerplate - package.json
Managing Packages with NPM

## Notes
### How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package
The `package.json` file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project, similar to how the `head` section of an HTML document describes the content of a webpage. It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. There are only two required fields; `name` and `version`, but it’s good practice to provide additional information about your project that could be useful to future users or maintainers.

If you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the `package.json` file on the top level of the tree. This is the file that you will be improving in the next couple of challenges.

One of the most common pieces of information in this file is the `author` field. It specifies who created the project, and can consist of a string or an object with contact or other details. An object is recommended for bigger projects, but a simple string like the following example will do for this project.

Add your name as the author of the project in the `package.json` file.


### Add a Description to Your package.json
The next part of a good package.json file is the `description` field; where a short, but informative description about your project belongs.

If some day you plan to publish a package to npm, this is the string that should sell your idea to the user when they decide whether to install your package or not. However, that’s not the only use case for the description, it’s a great way to summarize what a project does. It’s just as important in any Node.js project to help other developers, future maintainers or even your future self understand the project quickly.

Regardless of what you plan for your project, a description is definitely recommended. Here's an example:

```"description": "A project that does something awesome",```

Add a description to the package.json file of your project.
