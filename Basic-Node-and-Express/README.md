# Basic Node and Express

This is the boilerplate code for the Basic Node and Express Challenges. Instructions for working on these challenges start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express/

## Notes
### Meet the Node console
During the development process, it is important to be able to check whatâ€™s going on in your code.

Node is just a JavaScript environment. Like client side JavaScript, you can use the console to display useful debug information. On your local machine, you would see console output in a terminal. On Replit, a terminal is open in the right pane by default.

We recommend to keep the terminal open while working at these challenges. By reading the output in the terminal, you can see any errors that may occur.

Modify the `myApp.js` file to log "Hello World" to the console.
